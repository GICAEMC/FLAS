FLAS — Fan Local Area System

FLAS is an open system-level specification that defines the fundamental architectural, communication, and behavioral requirements of an intelligent fan microgrid system. The objective is to establish a common, open, and interoperable framework enabling plug-and-play operation, coordinated control, and intelligent management of fans within Low Voltage Direct Current (LVDC) based systems.

🎯 Why FLAS?
Ventilation systems represent a significant share of global electricity consumption.
+2

Current fan solutions are typically designed as isolated devices, leading to fragmented architectures and complex installation.
+2

Energy waste is often systemic; the problem is not just motor efficiency, but a lack of system-level intelligence and coordination.
+3

FLAS enables the transition from component-based products to integrated, system-oriented intelligent airflow solutions.

🚀 Key Features

System-Oriented Architecture: Multiple devices operate as nodes within a shared power and communication environment.
+2


Plug-and-Play Behavior: Devices are automatically detected, identified, and made operational with minimal manual configuration.
+1


AI Openness: Native support for local, centralized, or distributed artificial intelligence to handle optimization and predictive maintenance.
+3


Technological Neutrality: The specification focuses on functional and behavioral requirements rather than prescribing specific hardware or communication protocols.
+3


Scalable Conformance: Defined "Base" and "Advanced" conformance levels allow for gradual adoption of system capabilities.
